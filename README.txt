This is a pretty brittle and personal modification of the minutes
package.  It require LaTeX, requires a ton of other packages,
and probably will break when I install this on another machine.

Enjoy!

If you want to "complie" the dtx file into it's various compoents,
please simply run `make` or `make display`.

`make install` will distribute the files into your TEXMFHOME using
TDS layout.  `make uninstall` will delete them back out.

Do not forget to run `texhash` after you're done!
